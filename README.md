# Drinks_Mixer

- I like to imagine that this is an app used by a bar for users to quickly look up specialty drinks by liquor.

## Goals

- To create a simple app that lets users access an API for a list of offered drinks.

## Notes

- This app is NOT mobile friendly. I went into this with desktop in mind and if I were to do it again I would definitely have a more mobile approach in mind.
